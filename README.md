# Build an Image Search App with:

## Vanilla JS

All apps will contact the unsplash Image Search API.

> Image search API like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers)

`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos/`

> You will need an access key from unsplash.com. After signing up, create an application here:https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications

All apps will use the skeleton CSS framework:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/skeleton/2.0.4/skeleton.min.css">
```

And use this body style:

```css
body {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 2em auto 0 auto;
}
```

#### This app demonstrates:

* User Input
* DOM Events
* API Requests
* Conditional Rendering
* Rendering Lists of Data
